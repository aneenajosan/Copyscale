# Copyscale
An advanced multi-layer neural network analysis system designed to detect if AI models were trained on copyrighted content. Protect your intellectual property with comprehensive similarity detection across images and videos.

Content creators, movie studios, and copyright holders currently lack effective tools to detect and prove when their intellectual property has been used without permission to train generative AI models, leading to widespread unauthorized use and significant financial/creative losses. Copyscale helps protect your intellectual property.
